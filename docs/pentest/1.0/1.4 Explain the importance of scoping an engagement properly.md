# 1.3 Explain the importance of scoping an engagement properly
## Types of assessment
The assessment type is important, as it will help clarify the primary objectives for the engagement.
### Goals-based/objectives-based
A goals-based or objectives-based assessment attempts to evaluate the security within your organization through a simulated cyber-attack. Each objective or goal provides general instruction for a given test scenario; for example: obtain administrative access to the production database servers. This technique requires a great deal of forethought with objective  planning and helps to assess an organization’s people, processes, and technology.
### Compliance-based
Compliance-based assessments audit an organization’s ability to follow and implement a given set of security standards within an environment.

A **PCI Data Security Standard** (PCI DSS) assessment is for organizations who accept, process, or store payment card information for consumers and  merchants, and was introduced to protect against credit card fraud.

**HIPAA** compliance regulates the protection of personal health information (PHI).

**FISMA** is a U.S. federal law passed in 2002 that requires federal agencies to  adopt and implement an information security protection program.

### Red team
Red team assessment, or red teaming, will evaluate how well an organization  would fare given a scenario of a real-world attack. Red teaming involves stealth and blended methodologies (such as network penetration testing and social engineering). The goals of red teaming are to test time to detection, time to response, and resilience against specifically modeled threats using tactics not limited to a single attack scope.
## Special scoping considerations
### Premerger
Company mergers involve two or more companies that combine to create one legal entity. If you conduct a pentest against company A during a premerger, company B may have a vested interest in how the company’s assets and best interests are being protected, since weakness from company A could ultimately affect company B.
### Supply chain
A supply chain is the manufacturing, processing, and distribution of goods from company to consumer. A supply chain attack is a way of circumventing the weakest link in the supply chain in order to exploit the target organization. The supply chain may include other third parties outside of the target organization’s control. During the scoping process, ensure you know who all the players are going to be and define authorized boundaries for the pentest.
## Target selection
### Targets
#### Internal
##### On-Site vs off-site
#### External
#### First-party vs third-party hosted
#### Physical
#### Users
#### SSIDs
#### Applications
### Considerations
#### Allow list vs deny list
#### Security exceptions
##### IPS/WAF allow list
##### NAC
##### Certificate pinning
##### Company's policies

## Strategy
### Unknown environment vs known environment vs partially known environment

## Risk acceptance
## Tolerance to impact
## Scheduling
## Scope creep
## Threat actors
A threat actor is an individual or group that is capable of manifesting a threat and is motivated and capable of exploiting the assets of an organization.
| Threat Actor | Intent | Capabilities | Target |
|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| APT (Advanced Persistent threat) | Steal sensitive or valuable information | Stealthy, continuous, and sophisticated hackers | High-profile individuals and organizations|
| Script kiddies | Self-motivated, likely for personal gain or profit | Less skilled hacker that uses public tools, exploits, and techniques | Less risk-averse organizations or individuals with little to no knowledge of security |
| Hacktivist | Politically or socially motivated | One or more individuals with various levels of expertise | High-profile individuals and organizations |
| Insider threat | Revenge, financial, problems. or espionage | Insider knowledge; could have privileged acccess to information systems | Individual's current or previous place of employment |
