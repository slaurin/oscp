# 1.3 Explain the importance of scoping an engagement properly
## Types of assessment
The assessment type is important, as it will help clarify the primary objectives for the engagement.
### Goals-based/objectives-based
A goals-based or objectives-based assessment attempts to evaluate the security within your organization through a simulated cyber-attack. Each objective or goal provides general instruction for a given test scenario; for example: obtain administrative access to the production database servers. This technique requires a great deal of forethought with objective  planning and helps to assess an organization’s people, processes, and technology.
### Compliance-based
Compliance-based assessments audit an organization’s ability to follow and implement a given set of security standards within an environment.

A **PCI Data Security Standard** (PCI DSS) assessment is for organizations who accept, process, or store payment card information for consumers and  merchants, and was introduced to protect against credit card fraud.

**HIPAA** compliance regulates the protection of personal health information (PHI).

**FISMA** is a U.S. federal law passed in 2002 that requires federal agencies to  adopt and implement an information security protection program.

### Red team
Red team assessment, or red teaming, will evaluate how well an organization  would fare given a scenario of a real-world attack. Red teaming involves stealth and blended methodologies (such as network penetration testing and social engineering). The goals of red teaming are to test time to detection, time to response, and resilience against specifically modeled threats using tactics not limited to a single attack scope.
