# 1.1 Explain the importance of planning for an engagement

## Understanding the target audience

- Executive management
- Contracting and legal departement
- IT departement
- Pentesters

The stakeholders are information consumers, not just escalation points.
Each group will have a different understanding and expectation of the process.
For instance, executive management will want to know essential information and
updates in order to make strategic decisions for the organization both during
and after the engagement. They will not be as concerned with the technical details of the pentest report, like the IT department or security personnel will be. These differing understandings should influence a pentesterâ€™s communications(information type and presentation) during calls, emails, and reporting.

## Rules of engagement

## Communication escalation pat# 

## Resources and requirements
### Confidentiality of fiding
### Known vs unknown

## Budget
The organizational budget determines if there are funds available to support a pentest engagement.

## Impact analysis and remediation timelines
The impact analysis (IA) is a key aspect of requirements management and the formal approach to assessing the pros and cons of pursuing a course of action. It provides an accurate reason and understanding of why something is or is not needed.

The information gathered during an IA can be captured and organized in a document or using a project management tool.
