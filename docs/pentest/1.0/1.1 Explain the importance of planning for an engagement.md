## Pentest Methodology

|Planning & Scoping |Info Gathering & Vulnerability Identification | Attacks & Exploits | Reporting & Communication|
|----------------|-------------|-----------|---------|

## Understanding the target audience

- Executive management
- Contracting and legal departement
- IT departement
- Pentesters

The stakeholders are information consumers, not just escalation points.
Each group will have a different understanding and expectation of the process.
For instance, executive management will want to know essential information and
updates in order to make strategic decisions for the organization both during
and after the engagement. They will not be as concerned with the technical details of the pentest report, like the IT department or security personnel will be. These differing understandings should influence a pentesterâ€™s communications(information type and presentation) during calls, emails, and reporting.

## Rules of engagement (RoE)
The rules of engagement (RoE) document puts into writing the guidelines and constraints regarding the execution of a pentest-most importantly, what is and is not authorized for testing.

Key elements include:
- The timeline for the engagement and when testing can be conducted
- What locations, systems, applications, or other potential targets are included or excluded.
- Data handling requirements for information gathered during the penetration test.
- What behaviors to expect from the target.
- Legal concerns should also be addressed, including a synopsis of any regulatory concerns affecting the target organization, pentest team, any remote locations, and any service providers who will be in-scope.
- When and how communications will occur.
- Whom to contact in case of particular events, such as evidence of ongoing compromise, accidental breach of RoE, a critical vulnerability discovered, and other events that warrant immediate attention.
- Who is permitted to engage the pentest team.



The RoE is established before starting a pentest and gives the pentest team authorization to conduct defined activities without any other permission.
## Communication escalation path 
A communication escalation path will need to be properly defined in the rules of engagement (RoE) to help remedy issues that may rise during testing.
An escalation path helps define a chain of command as well as helps resolve and manage conflict. In the event a critical service or system goes down during testing, the pentest team will already know which buttons to dial on the phone to let someone in the chain of command know what happened.
## Resources and requirements
### Confidentiality of fiding
### Known vs unknown

## Budget
The organizational budget determines if there are funds available to support a pentest engagement.
The budget required to complete a penetration test is determined by the scope and rules of engagement (or, at times, vice versa if the budget is a  limiting factor, thus determining what can reasonably be done as part of the assessment!).
## Impact analysis and remediation timelines
The impact analysis (IA) is a key aspect of requirements management and the formal approach to assessing the pros and cons of pursuing a course of action. It provides an accurate reason and understanding of why something is or is not needed.

The information gathered during an IA can be captured and organized in a document or using a project management tool.
## Disclaimers

### Point-in-time assessment
### Comprehensiveness

## Technical constraints
Technical constraints identify technological challenges and obstacles that could negatively affect the organization.

## Support resources
The customer may wish to provide additional support resources to assist with the pentest. These resources can be independent artifacts either specified in the RoE or provided to the pentest team after the RoE is signed.
