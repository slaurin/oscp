# 1.1 Explain the importance of planning for an engagement

## Understanding the target audience

- Executive management
- Contracting and legal departement
- IT departement
- Pentesters

The stakeholders are information consumers, not just escalation points.
Each group will have a different understanding and expectation of the process.
For instance, executive management will want to know essential information and
updates in order to make strategic decisions for the organization both during
and after the engagement. They will not be as concerned with the technical details of the pentest report, like the IT department or security personnel will be. These differing understandings should influence a pentesterâ€™s communications(information type and presentation) during calls, emails, and reporting.

## Rules of engagement (RoE)
The rules of engagement (RoE) document puts into writing the guidelines and constraints regarding the execution of a pentest-most importantly, what is and is not authorized for testing; for example, whether or not brute force is an allowed tactic, whether brute force counts are limited by password lockout policies, automated fuzzing vs. manual exploitation, etc.
The RoE is established before starting a pentest and gives the pentest team authorization to conduct defined activities without any other permission.
## Communication escalation path 
A communication escalation path will need to be properly defined in the rules of engagement (RoE) to help remedy issues that may rise during testing.
An escalation path helps define a chain of command as well as helps resolve and manage conflict. In the event a critical service or system goes down during testing, the pentest team will already know which buttons to dial on the phone to let someone in the chain of command know what happened.
## Resources and requirements
### Confidentiality of fiding
### Known vs unknown

## Budget
The organizational budget determines if there are funds available to support a pentest engagement.

## Impact analysis and remediation timelines
The impact analysis (IA) is a key aspect of requirements management and the formal approach to assessing the pros and cons of pursuing a course of action. It provides an accurate reason and understanding of why something is or is not needed.

The information gathered during an IA can be captured and organized in a document or using a project management tool.
## Disclaimers

### Point-in-time assessment
### Comprehensiveness

## Technical constraints
Technical constraints identify technological challenges and obstacles that could negatively affect the organization.

## Support resources
The customer may wish to provide additional support resources to assist with the pentest. These resources can be independent artifacts either specified in the RoE or provided to the pentest team after the RoE is signed.
