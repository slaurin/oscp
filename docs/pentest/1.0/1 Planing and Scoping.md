## **Exam Essentials**
**Be able to explain the importance of planning and scoping engagements.** 
Planning a penetration test requires understanding why the test is being conducted and who the target audience of the closeout report is. While the penetration test is being planned, important elements include the rules of engagement, communications and emergency escalation plans, requirements like confidentiality and resource availability, the overall budget for the assessment, and any technical or business constraints that are in place. The rules of engagement are one of the most critical parts of this planning and usually include the scope: what can and cannot be tested. 

**Understand target selection and target selection considerations.** 
Target selection determines how much effort will be required to complete an assessment, how complex the assessment will be, and whether you will needthird-party involvement or permissions to test systems that are not directly owned by the target of the penetration test. In white box (or total knowledge) assessments, target selection is usually much simpler. A black box (or zero knowledge) assessment can make target selection much more difficult and needs to be carefully scoped and defined to ensure that only legitimate targets are tested. 

**Understand the key legal concepts related to penetration testing.**
Penetration testers need to understand legal concepts like master services agreements that define the overall contract between organizations for engagements, statements of work that define the deliverables for those engagements, and nondisclosure agreements that protect the data and information involved in a penetration test. You must also be aware of the legal and regulatory environment in which both you and your target operate so that your testing process and tools are legal. Finally, itâ€™s critical to ensure that appropriate legal agreements, with approvals from proper signing authorities, are in place so that you are covered in the event of something going wrong.

**Explain the issues, objectives, and caveats that you may encounter when conducting compliance-based assessments.** 
Compliance, in the form of laws, regulations, and industry standards, drives many penetration tests. Understanding that laws like GLBA, HIPAA, SOX, and others have specific requirements that you may need to meet as part of your testing process will help you better complete compliance assessments. Standards like PCI DSS that require compliance from credit card merchants provide clearly defined objectives, but also have specific rules that may influence both how you conduct your assessment and the rules of engagement for the overall test.
