# Explain the key aspects of compliance-based assessments

## Compliance-bases assessment, limitations and caveats
Laws and regulations like HIPAA, FERPA, SOX, GLBA, and PCI DSS all have compliance requirements that covered organizations have to meet.
### Rules to complete assessment
The PCI DSS standard provides examples of this, including its definition of what a cardholder data environment (CDE) penetration test should include: the entire external, public-facing perimeter as well as the LAN-to-LAN attack surfaces. Fortunately, PCI DSS provides specific guidance for penetration testing at https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Penetration_Testing_Guidance_March_
### Password policies
Password policies, which are important for both the scope of the engagement and the rules of engagement. Again, the PCI DSS penetration testing guidance provides a useful example by noting that whether or not the tester must disclose all passwords they discover during their assessment is an important part of the rules of engagement and the scoping of the assessment.
### Data isolation
Data isolation may come into play when systems that are covered by a compliance agreement or requirement are maintained separately from other elements of an organization’s infrastructure. Scoping the penetration test to only validate the compliance environment can be important, but understanding how the data isolation design fits in the context of the organization’s infrastructure is crucial too.
### Key management
Key management testing may be required to meet a standard like the US federal government’s Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2. The organization’s practices, policies, and key management system technology may all fall into scope when assessed against requirements like FIPS 140-2. As it does in other compliance assessment areas, using third parties like Amazon’s AWS means that their practices and policies may also fall into scope. Fortunately, major cloud providers frequently have pre-certified environments and can provide FIPS 140-2 compliance documentation upon request.
### Limitations
#### Limited network access / Limited storage access
Limited network access and limited storage access are also common in compliance-driven assessments. PCI DSS–compliant organizations have often isolated their card processing systems on a separate network with distinct infrastructure, which means that access to the environment via the network and the ability to access storage or other underlying services may be highly restricted. Penetration testers need to understand both the environment they will test and any functional or business limitations they must respect when testing in restricted compliance environments.

## Clearly defined objectives based on regulations
HIPAA, GLBA, SOX, PCI-DSS, and FIPS 140-2 each have compliance requirements that may drive assessments, making it important for you to be aware of them at a high level.

**HIPAA**, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, does not directly require penetration testing or vulnerability scanning. It does, however, require a risk analysis, and this requirement drives testing of security controls and practices. NIST suggest that penetration testing be part of the evaluation process.

**GLBA**, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, regulates how financial institutions handle personal information of individuals. It requires companies to have a written information security plan that describes processes and procedures intended to protect that information, and covered entities must also test and monitor their efforts. Penetration testing may be (and frequently is) part of that testing methodology because GLBA requires financial institutions to protect against “reasonably anticipated threats”—something that is easier to do when you are actively conducting penetration tests.

**SOX**, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is a US federal law that set standards for USpublic company boards, management, and accounting firms. SOX sets standards for controls related to policy, standards, access and authentication, network security, and a variety of other requirements. A key element of SOX is a yearly requirement to assess controls and procedures, this potentially driving a desire for penetration testing. 

**PCI DSS**, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, is an industry standard for security created by the credit card industry.

**FIPS 140-2** is a US government computer security standard used to approved cryptographic modules. These modules are then certified under FIPS 140-2 and can be assessed based on that certification and the practices followed in their use.
