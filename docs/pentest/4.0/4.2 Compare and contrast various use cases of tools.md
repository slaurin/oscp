### OSINT
The [OSINT Framework](http://osintframework.com) is a static web page focused on information gathering and provides web links and resources that can be used during the reconnaissance process.

#### dig
This tool is used to interrogate DNS servers and is sometimes used by administrators to troubleshoot DNS-related problems.
#### whois
WHOIS (pronounced as the phrase "who is") is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other information. The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-readable format.
#### nslookup
The nslookup command can be used to resolve the name of the domain to an IP address—this is called a forward DNS lookup. A reverse DNS lookup is the opposite—this process resolves the IP address to the domain name.
#### Foca
Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives, or FOCA for short, is a Microsoft  Windows–based tool used to find metadata hidden in document (like Microsoft Word). The latest version of FOCA can be downloaded from the developer’s GitHub page at https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA.
#### theHarvester
The latest version of the tool can be found on the developer’s GitHub page at https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester. theHarvester is a Python-based framework, is simple to use, and includes options to allow either passive or active queries to gather target information.
#### Shodan
The [Shodan](https://shodan.io) search engine scans the entire Internet, parsing banners for services
and categorizing the data returned by each device.
#### Maltego
[Maltego](https://www.paterva.com) Is an interactive data mining software tool that can help users visualize and analyze relationships using publicly accessible data from the Internet.
#### Recon-NG
Open source powerful web reconnaissance framework, very similar to theHarvester
and written in Python
#### Censys
Censys was created in 2015 at the University of Michigan by the same security researchers who created ZMap. Censys works very much the same way as Shodan, as it allows users to query using keywords and filters to discover and investigate devices, and to include public-facing IP addresses and domain names with open ports and services on the Internet.
